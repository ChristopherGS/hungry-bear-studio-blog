Hello! Introductions.... Ive been coding since 2016, before that i was a scaffholder and before that i worked in restaurants and pubs for 10 years. Its not been an easy road finding the thing i love to do, in between the before and now i met my wife, had child, bought a house, moved country and learned a new language!

Im from england, i went to univercity to study Film and Broadcast Production (dreams of stardom unfortunately didnt pan out) in London and at the same time worked in pubs and restaurants. It was there i met my wife who was working as an Au Pair. Fast forward a couple of years and we were living in a house share and she was pregnant with our first child. We decided to move to Sweden (where she is from) due to housing costs, quality of life etc..

Given my lack of Swedish it was difficult to find work so I started working as a scaffholder. I had never done this job before but it was manual labor and so didnt really require any language skills on my part. I did that for 6 years, and with every passing year i grew more and more depressed. It wasnt what i wanted to do, i needed a creative outlet and so in my spare time i started a new business. I designed wooden sunglasses. This was my first taste of web design. I used Shopify(link) and put together a tasty little website to sell my glasses on.

It was a fun time and we created a small following, selling our glasses in shops in Stockholm and locally in our home town of Ã–rnskÃ¶ldsvik (in the north of Sweden, where we live!), we also had moderate online success.

Unfortunately with a growing family (we had another baby!) and lack of marketing funds i decided to sell up and managed to make a tidy profit selling the business to an american chap. Im not sure what he is doing with the company anymore but you can check out the website at sideroot (link).

And so i was back to square one, in a a job i hated with nothing to look forward to with my career. It was at this point my wife suggested i take a local course in C# .NET. I was dubious to begin with but decided to check it out. It requiered me to know Swedish and to have passed a basic programming course in C++.

And so i set to work, i took time off my scaffholding job and enrolled in the local adult collage to study Swedish and programming. It took me 2 years but once i had the right qualifications i applied to the C# course and was accepted!

Long story short (bit late for that statement maybe! ðŸ˜„) I enjoyed it so much i actually aced it! During the course we had to do work experience and i ended up at a great local company called Clavister (link) which works with network security. My passion, i had found throughout the course, had been frontend code and so when the time came to appy for a job i went for it and got a job as a frontend developer :ðŸ•º (offical title software developer)

And thats where i have been since May 2018. I began learning JavaScript on the job along with React, Redux and TypeScript. I had never used this stack before, more used to C# ASP.NET Core but i loved it and from there i started to research my own projects. Its then i found Gatsby and fell in love. I cant stress enough how much fun it is to program sites in Gatsby! .. more about gatsby, themes, mobile apps, expo etc...
